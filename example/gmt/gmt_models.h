 * Used in distributed mode so that points are moved to the appropriate
 * processes before refinement. After usage of this function, the first 
 * model->num_resp points in  model->points are the points intersecting the
 * process' domain that the process is responsible for propagating in the
 * subsequent iteration. The remaining model->num_own points are those
 * intersecting the process' domain (and hence relevant for refinement) that
 * the process is not responsible for propagating. This function also handles
 * updating the field model->M to reflect the total number of points on each 
 * process.  
 * 
 * To support distributed mode a model should (in setup) load a distinct
 * subset of points on each process. Each process must set model->M as the
 * number of points loaded on that process. A point must be represented by a
 * struct of size model->point_size and points must be stored in the array
 * model->points, which hence has size model->M * model->point_size. The
 * intersection function model->intersect should be written so that an input
 * of m refers to the mth point stored in model->points. If a model needs to
 * rearrange the order of the points, then it should respect the subdivision
 * (described above) into points that the process is responsible/not 
 * responsible for propagating.
 * 
 * \param[in] p4est     The forest is not modified.
